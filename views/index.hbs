        <h2>Who? What?</h2>

        <p class="text">Murph is a gentleman of the South who loves meat. In fact, he loves meat so much that he doesn't eat anything else.
            A few people have raised eyebrows about this dietary practice, but the man is alive and healthy. In fact, he
            wants to share his appreciation of animal flesh with the rest of the world, which is why he started Murph's Meat-Up™.
            As the name might suggest, people gather around for a cook out and bring along their choice of meat. There is
            no need for a side dish, because why have a side when you can just have more meat? Exactly. The Meat-Up™ happens
            on the first Sunady of every month, starting around 1:00pm in Murph's backyard on the special grill. If you are
