Murph's Meat-Up™

Our old pal and classmate, Murph Potts, is a protein lover from The South. As of this writing, he is on a protein diet, which means that he is pretty much living the life of a pure carnivore. I thought that it would be fun to make a mock Meet-Up (Meat-Up) event,in which people would gather and basically have a big grill out. Each attendee will choose their meat item to bring and throw upon the communal pit, offering up their proposed recipe as well. The attendees and subsequent items of meat being brought to the event will be listed on the main page, so everyone can see who is attending and what is being served at Murph's Meat-Up™.
