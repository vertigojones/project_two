### Project Two, General Assembly WDI-14

I created this project as an alternative look at social media, with a fun incorporation of the meet-up platform. It is something that could be expanded on to include themes and allow the users to really customize the look. If I had some extra time I would have created a log in page, plus allowed the users to interact with each other via comments, etc. That way this would be more like a Slack group but with a less serious approach, and something more colorful than a FaceBook Event. Definitely great for parties and get togethers! For my personal theme (and to show off the fun you can have), I chose the following:

### Murph's Meat-Up™

Our old pal and classmate, Murph Potts, is a protein lover from The South. As of this writing, he is on a protein diet, which means that he is pretty much living the life of a pure carnivore. I thought that it would be fun to make a mock Meet-Up (Meat-Up) event,in which people would gather and basically have a big grill out. Each attendee will choose their meat item to bring and throw upon the communal pit, offering up their proposed recipe as well. The attendees and subsequent items of meat being brought to the event will be listed on the main page, so everyone can see who is attending and what is being served at Murph's Meat-Up™.
